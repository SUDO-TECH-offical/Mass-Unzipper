DO NOT REUPLOAD MY WORK! AND IF YOU DO YOU BETTER ATLEAST SAY YOU GOT THE CODE FROM @SUDO-TECH ON TIKTOK PLEASE!

This is a mass unzip tool! we currently have these features in our latest version at the time of making this (v3)
The script searches the selected folder and all subfolders for .zip files
Automatic extraction
Delete after extraction (optional)
Skip current file
Non-blocking GUI (separate thread so UI doesnt freeze up)
Logs so you can see everything thats happening
Dark/Light Mode
Resizable window (proper resizing that wasnt there in v1)
Persistent history the app makes a little txt file with the history of what you unzipped using it!
History viewer A separate window shows previously unzipped files (up to the last 500 entries)
Error logging Any failed extraction is recorded in the log and saved in history
Error handling Prevents the app from crashing if a zip is corrupt or unreadable

These are what i plan on adding to this app 
make it a proper windows app (so your not forced to use python but i plan to keep a python version for linux and MacOS)
Optional history (you can choose so the app doesnt see your history or keep it on your computer
Drag n drop folder support 
Auto skipping for corrupted Zip files
in the final version (v5) i plan to improve the UI and make it more nice looking
